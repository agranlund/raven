I am using the newer ATF1508 fitter v1918 extracted from the Atmel Prochip package.
It's probably going to work fine with the old version bundled with WinCUPL but I have not tested it.

ATF1508AS can be programmed in-place using ATMISP software and ATDH1150USB programming cable.
Both of the ATF22V10C chips needs to be programmed off-board in an external programmer.
