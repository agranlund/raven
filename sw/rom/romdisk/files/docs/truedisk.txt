TrueDisk - the only true RAM disk
=================================

v2.2 (c) 1989-1994 by Christoph Zwerschke

Very short English instructions:

TRUEDISK.PRG should run as one of the first programs in the AUTO
folder. It provides a fast and uncomplicated reset resident RAM
disk. The default drive is M: and the default size is 512 kBytes.
You can change this by pressing the alternate or control key when
TRUEDISK.PRG ist started.

If you want to access the TrueDisk from the desktop, you'll have
to install a desktop icon for the TrueDisk, of course.

Whether the TrueDisk will be installed in ST-RAM or TT-RAM depends
on the "program load flag" in the program header of TRUEDISK.PRG.

There are two small auxiliary programs: ZEROTRUE.PRG will erase
the whole TrueDisk while KILLTRUE.PRG will remove the TrueDisk
completely. Warning: There are no security checkings!!!

"TrueDisk" is a "Public Domain" program. It may be copied and
given away as long as it stays in a non commercial scale. If you
like the program, you can write to me and send a small donation.
