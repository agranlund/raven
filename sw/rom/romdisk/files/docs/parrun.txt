PARRUN 1.3 - directly receive into and execute from RAM via PARCP-USB
by Daniel Illgen (insane.tscc.de)
based upon PARCP by Petr Stehlik

PARRUN allows you to transfer an Atari TOS executable into the Atari's Memory
and directly execute it from there without needing any RAM-DISK or Disk Access

to use it run PARRUN.TOS on the ATARI (the server side)
the client side has only been tested under linux

you need libhidapi-libusb as well as libusb installed
(apt-get install libhidapi-libusb0 libusb-1.0-0 under Debian/Ubuntu)

usage:
$ parrun [st-directory] file

examples:
$ parrun wip.tos 
- transfers >wip.tos< to the ST's memory and runs it

$ parrun d:/tmp wip.tos
- changes the ST directory to D:\TMP, transfers WIP.TOS to RAM and runs it
- useful for programs which load data from the ST's disk

This allows you to test your programs on floppy disk-only systems as well as
saving the write cycles of e.g. Compact-Flash Media.

This program uses the transfer routines as well as the handshaking logic of
PARallel CoPy - which is available under http://joy.sophics.cz/parcp/

A huge THANK YOU to Petr for developing PARCP as well as PARCP-USB and
releasing the source code to PARCP which made this possible

- What's new in v1.3?
* Win32 Version doesn't need DLLs anylonger
* 77kB/s for PARRUNF
* fix BSS clear error
+ add TOS 1.00 version (doesn't support directory changes)
+ add autoboot disk image file

- What's new in v1.2?
* 72kB/s for PARRUNF

- What's new in v1.1?
* Buffer-size increased from 16k to 64k
+ PARRUNF added
-> fast version for standard ST(E); no timeouts, direct ym2149 chip writing 
   (without querying the ym2149 ports) - ONLY FOR USAGE UNDER TOS!
   NOT FOR MINT OR MAGIC OR OTHER MULTITASKING OS
   Allows 64kB/s - same speed as 16MHz MegaSTE
