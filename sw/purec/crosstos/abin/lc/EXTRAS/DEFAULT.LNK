; default.lnk - an example CLINKWITH default file

; This file forces the linker to always place programs & data in TT RAM
; (when available), and increases the output buffers to 32K (from 4K);
; note that you should have plenty of memory available in order to do this!
;
TTLOAD			; all programs in TT RAM
TTMALLOC		; all programs 'Malloc'ing from TT RAM
BUFSIZE -32768		; a nice big output buffer
