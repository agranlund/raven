                                Introduction
                                ============


       Shiced was developed for 2 reasons. First the lack of Atari producing an
icon editor and second to make a little money.

       The minimum requirements for hardware are as follows, 520ST computer, 1
single side disk drive, and a monochrome monitor.  If animation is desired then
a color monitor is required and may be substituted for the monochrome monitor.

       The disk included in this package should contain 10 files on disk.  These
files are ATBALL.C, ATBALL.S, ATBALL.SHP, SDASM.PRG, SDASM.S, SDC.C, SDC.PRG,
SDCST.S, SE.PRG, SE.RSC.  Here is a quick explanation of what each file does or
pertains to.

ATBALL.C
--------
       This is the compiled file from SHICED that is to be used in C
programming.

ATBALL.S
--------
       A compiled file also from SHICED that is to be use in Assembler
programming.

ATBALL.SHP
----------
       The file SHICED saved of the shapes binary image.

SDASM.PRG
---------
       This is the actual assembled-executable code of a bouncing ball demo.  It
is an Assembler program and is short for Shape Draw ASseMbler PRoGram file.

SDASM.S
-------
       This is the source code on how the shape was drawn to the screen.  It was
then assembled into SDASM.PRG.

SDC.C
-----
       This is the source code on how the shape was drawn to the screen.  It is
a 'C' source file compatible with Digital Researches compiler and linker. It is
short for Shape Draw 'C'.


SDC.PRG
-------
       This is the 'C' source code and assembler source code mixed together.  It
is a combination of SDC.C and SDCST.S.

SDCST.S
-------











       This is the source code written in assembler for accessing shape drawing
routines from 'C' compiler.  It contains routines written in assembler but
specifically designed to be called from 'C'. It is short for Shape Draw 'C'
STart module.

SE.PRG
------
       This is the SHICED program for editing and compiling shapes. It is
abbreviated for easier accessing.  The abbreviation stands for Shiced Editor.

SE.RSC
------
       This is a file that SHICED needs to put up the menus when the program is
executed.






















































                             Working With the Mouse
                             ----------------------

       When booting the SHICED program be sure to have the resolution set to
what you want and to have the desk top accessories loaded in case you would like
to change the colors in the palette.

       The mouse is very simple to use in that when you are in the window with
the grid in it and press the left button the color will be plotted in the
current selected color.  The default startup color is white.  The right button
on the mouse is used to erase, which is essentially using the background color
and plotting it on the grid.  As you plot on the grid notice the window at the
top right of the screen it will plot the pixels or dots corresponding to what
you have plotted in the grid.

       In order to start the plotting or erasing process the mouse button needs
to be held down for about a half a second or so.  You then can move anywhere in
the grid and and it will plot or erase wherever you move the arrow to in the
grid.

       Thats about all there is to moving the mouse around the screen at this
time.











































                                "DESK" Menu Option
                                 -----------------

       The Menu at the top of the screen has four words in it for accessing
functions of the SHICED editor.  The first menu option is "DESK".  In it should
be at least two things.  "About SHICED..." and "Control Panel".  If these two
are not in the menu then you will have to quit and reboot to load in the desk
accessories.

       "About SHICED..." will bring up information about SHICED and the Author
and company name.  Just click on "OK" when you are finished looking at it.

       "Control Panel" is where you can change the colors from for your shapes.
The shapes are limited to 16 colors at one time, which is called a palette.



















































                               "FILE" Menu Option
                               ------------------

       This menu option should have the following options available.  "Load
Shape...", "Save Shape...", "Compile Shape...", "Clear Shape" and "Quit".

       "Load Shape" is an option for loading shapes off of disk and into memory
to be edited.  To use this option click on it when it is highlighted and up will
pop a directory and menu selection option.  To select a new directory just point
the arrow to the old directory and press the mouse button.  Then type in the new
directory and move the mouse pointer into the box with all of the files listed
and press the mouse button.  To select a file to load either double click on the
filename wanted or click on the filename once and move the mouse pointer over to
the "OK" button and click it once.  To abort this operation and not load a file
at all, simply click on the "ABORT" button once and it will abort the process.
After you have finished the shape will be loaded into memory and redrawn to the
screen for editing.

       "Save Shape" works the same way as with "Load Shape" except for a new
name of a file to save, position the mouse pointer over the blank filename and
press the mouse button once.  Then you may type a new file name in and click on
the "OK" or "Abort" button.  The program will save your shape out to disk.  The
files that the program looks for when loading a file are all the ones with an
.SHP extension.  So for easier use of the program we recommend that you use this
extension when saving shapes.

       "Compile Shape" compiles a shapes binary image into a source code that
has been selected by the user.  When you select this option you will get a
message asking you the "Base file name to compile to.".  What this means is that
you give it a filename to save the source code(s) under.  However you must not
add an extension to the filename.  You can however select subdirectories, and
only a seven character base file name.  The reason for this is that when it
compiles a shape if you select the extension it will write one file out to disk
only and it may not even be the one you wanted.         After you have selected
the filename you can either select "OK" to continue or "Abort" to abort the
operation.  If you select "OK" the disk will start to spin and it will write the
files you have selected to compile to. * see "Options" Menu Option - "File
Select...".

       "Clear Shape" clears the shape you are currently working on to the
background color.  It does not however clear the other shape that you are not
working on. * see "Options" Menu option - "Mask Edit".

       "Quit" is really quite simple it exits the program immediatly.  Make sure
you have saved the shapes that you want to keep before quitting the program.





















                                "Adjust" Menu Option
                                --------------------

       There are four items in this menu option. "Flip Shape", "Mirror Shape",
"Rotate Left", "Rotate Right".

       "Flip Shape" takes the shape drawn currently and flips it upside down one
time.  The shape is then redrawn to its new location.

       "Mirror Shape" takes the shape draw and mirrors it from the left to the
right and vice-versa.  This is especially useful in making images going in both
directions.  example: you have draw pacman facing in the left direction.  to
make him face right select this option and he will be facing right.

       "Rotate Left" rotates the shapes image left 90 degress.  Example: if
pacman is facing left and you select this option he will be facing up.

       "Rotate Right" rotates the shapes image right 90 degrees.  Example:  if
pacman is facing left and you select this option he will be facing down.















































                              "Options" Menu Option
                              ---------------------

       There are 5 selections in this Menu option.  The include "File
Output...", "Color Select...", "Mask Edit", "Invert Shape", "Copy Shape".

       "File Output" outputs a selection box that allows you to choose a file
type to compile to, C, assembler,Icon & Mask or Bit Image.  The Icon & Mask and
Bit Image selections are for Resource Construction Set and also can be called
from C compiler.  Just select the ones you want to compile to, all can be
selected at once if you like, and press the "OK" button they will then be used
when you compile the shape.  If none are selected, which is default, then the
compiler will do nothing at all and return you to edit mode.

       "Color Select" selects the plotting color used. With the left mouse
button, select a color by moving the pointer to that color and push the mouse
button.  After you have finished selecting the color desired, select the "OK"
button to exit back to edit mode.

       "Mask Edit" changes you over to another shape to edit.  The "Mask" of a
shape is the shapes background.  What it basically does is blacken out the
background before the shape is drawn so that the colors around the shape won't
bleed into the shapes color.  If this happens the shape sometimes become fuzzy
or difficult to figure what they are.  This extra precaution makes shapes stand
out much better and make for a sharper looking object altogether.  When editing
the "Mask" the only two colors you will be using are black and white.  Any other
colors tend to have different effects on the outcome of the final shape, when
viewed in the editor. These are converted to black and white when output to
files on the disk.  The "Mask" should be an exact copy of the shape except for
in all black. * see "Copy Shape".

       "Invert Shape" basically takes the shape you are working on and makes a
negative of it.  For instance it takes all the white dots and makes them black
and takes all the black dots and makes them white.  For the other colors it
takes the opposite color like color 16 becomes color 0 and color 15 becomes
color 1 and so on and so on.

       "Copy Shape" copies the shapes data that you are not working on and
copies it to the shapes data you are working on.  Say you were working on the
"Mask", just select copy function and the shapes data is copied. Now all you
have to do is change any color to black and you have a finished shape and mask.
Now if you were working on the shapes data and wanted a duplicate of the masks
data you can also copy the mask to the data.























                               Other Functions
                               ---------------

       There are a few other functions that are not in the menu selections.
These are going to be explained here.

       Selecting the top right window, by moving the pointer over it and
pressing the mouse button, will reveal arrows around the window.  These are for
moving the shape 1 dot in any of the directions that the arrows are pointing.
After you have moved the shape in the direction you want you can go back to the
grid window and it will redraw the fatbits it the corresponding location of the
scroll of the top right window.  I have found this an invaluable tool and
timesaver.  I have draw a lot of shapes that have ran out of room on the grid in
one direction or the other and have needed to move them to the right or left.
Also when the scroll takes place there is a wrap in the direction of the scroll,
for example if you scroll left once.  the line at the left edge of the shape
will scroll left and off of the shape and then be put back on at the right side
of the shape.

       The botton right window that says "Final Shape" on it when selected
reveals what the shape would look like with the mask and the shape put together
on a color background.  If no shapes shows up don't worry, it just means that
the shape and mask put together do not sync right and you need to edit them
until it does show up.










































                                 Techniques
                                 ----------

       There is a special technique use in animation to get a flicker free shape
with smooth animation called page flipping.  Here is a brief explanation of how
this is done.

       The screen on the Atari 520ST can be placed in memory at any location
with a 512 byte boundary.  So what is done is this. Two pages are set up and
cleared to the same background.  One of the pages is turned on so you can see it
on the video monitor.  While this one is showing all the erasing and drawing of
shapes takes place on the other screen.  This prevents flicker to the eye
because you cannot see the erasing and drawing going on.  Here is a graphic
example of how it is done. * denotes which screen is showing.
