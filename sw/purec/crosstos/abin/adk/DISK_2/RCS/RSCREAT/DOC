The following contains the steps to be
taken to create a resource file for the
ATARI ST.  WE assume that you have
access to the resource construction set
on the IBM PC as well as Kermit at both
ends.

1) Create your resource file with the
resource construction set.  Make sure
that you have told the program to save
the source file (.c).  This is done
from the output menu.

2) Send the file to the ST using Kermit

3) Edit the file stcreate.c.  You will
need to include your resource file name
on line 41 of this file, it now has
<dummy.h>.

4) compile stcreate.c link using the
.imp file as an example. run stcreate
it will produce a resource file with a
.rsc extension.
