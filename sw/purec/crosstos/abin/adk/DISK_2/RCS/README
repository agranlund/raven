The ".c" that was produced as an output option is now a ".rsh"
file.  The ".def" file is now a ".dfn" file.  If there exists
a ".def" file that was created by RCS version 1.0 on an IBM PC
or compatible; it simply needs to be renamed using the ".dfn"
extension in place of the ".def".  If there exists a ".def"
file created by RCS version 1.0 on a Motorola 68k processor;
ie. Atari ST, Lisa, Meridian etc., that file must be processed
using the utility program called "def2dfn.prg" before it can be
used with RCS version 2.0.

	To use the utility program, "def2dfn.prg" simply type
"def2dfn <filename without extension> carriage return" or just
"def2dfn carriage return" and wait to be prompted to input the
filename.  The input file is a ".def" file created by RCS 
version 1.0 on a MC68K processor.  The output is a ".dfn" which
is compatible with the format used by the RCS version 2.0 and
that produced by the Intel i86 family of processors used in IBM
PC's and compatibles.

	The RCS is still being upgraded and we encourage any
any deficiences to be reported to Atari via developer support
on GEnie, Compuserve, Bix, or usenet.
