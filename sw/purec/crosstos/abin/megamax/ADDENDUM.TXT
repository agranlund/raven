
**** Corrections to the Manual
Changes as of 3/11/88

1. SHELL
--------
    The shell searches \MEGAMAX, A:\, and A:\MEGAMAX in that order for 
    both the .RSC and .CFG files.

    ^C while output is occuring terminates to the desktop as 
    opposed to the shell. Use ^delete to return to the shell.
        
    $HOME environment variable - sets the inital default directory for 
    shell. 

    Screen location of opened windows are saved when the config file is
    written.  Windows revert to their original location when they are
    closed (except for stdio). 

    ^S and ^Q are now functional in the stdio window.

    Windows may be topped from the WINDOW menu bar now.

    Executing commands in the stdio window does not need an extension to be
    specified.  For example, "cat hello.c" is the same as "cat.ttp hello.c".

    Pg 32. "Read configuration" is documented as only displaying .CFG files, 
    but instead it displays all files.
            
    Pg 45, 47. The pictures have wrong file names for initialization code
    and the C system library.  Use "INIT.O" and "LIBC.A" as documented in
    the text.

    Pg 52. Menu Summary - "Flush Resident Programs" should be described as 
    flushing programs that have been made RAM resident in the shell.

2. LIBRARY
----------
    Pg 497. Function Pexec().  The line in the middle of the page which
    reads:

        "4    just go      pathname = address of the base page."

    should instead read:

        "4    just go      commandline = address of the base page."

    Pg 110, 134. abs() is no longer a macro.  You should now use labs() for
    longs, dabs() for floats, and abs() for ints.

    pg 157. #include <string.h> should be <strings.h>

3. SYMBOLIC DEBUGGER LIBRARY
----------------------------
    There is a Symbolic debugger library included with this version of the
    Laser Shell. The debugger is described in DEBUGGER.TXT

4. COMPILER
-----------
    There is a new option -X which outputs information used by the debugger.
    This information is  in the form of a call to "_dbugin" at the beginning of
    each function and a call to "_dbugout" at the end of each function.
    The $XLIB environment variable is the path to the debugger lib for the -X 
    option to cc.

    A new option -W has been added to the compiler which will supress all
    warning messages.

    sizeof() returns an unsigned or an unsigned long if the size of the array 
    is too great to fit in an unsigned. The compiler will generate a warn-
    ing when sizeof returns an unsigned long.
    

5. LINKER
---------
    There is a new option -X which sets the -M and -G flags to true.  This
    is the debugger.  The -M option now writes a Map file to a file called
    "MAPFILE" on the current drive and directory. It used to write the Map
    information to stdout.

6. CC
-----
    There is a new option -X which is passed to the compiler and the linker.
    The -X option to cc will also pass the pathname given in the environment
    variable $XLIB to the linker.  $XLIB should contain the pathname to the
    Symbolic Debugger Library (see the text file DEBUGGER.TXT included on this
    disk).  It is passed to the linker after all user supplied file names
    and before the C System Library.  For example:

    Given the environment variable settings:

        $CINCLUDE=\megamax\headers
        $CINIT=\megamax\init.o
        $CLIB=\megamax\libc.a
        $XLIB=\megamax\libx.a

    The command line:

        cc -x a.c b.c

    is equivalent to the command lines:

        ccom -x -I\megamax\headers a.c
        ccom -x -I\megamax\headers b.c
        ld -x \megamax\init.o a.o b.o \megamax\libx.a \megamax\libc.a

7. RCP
------
    The Resource Construction Program can now create resources up to 64k 
    instead of 32k.

    There is now a maximum of 2000 objects in a tree.

8. AR
-----
    A ranlib is done automatically upon creation of an archive.  The L key
    is still supported.  The LV combination will now print the name of each
    archive component as it is examined for global names.  Any component
    which is not either a Laser object or a DRI object is ignored.

    The T key (table of contents) now allows file names to be supplied
    such that only matching file names in the archive are printed.

9. MISCELLANEOUS DOCUMENTATION CHANGES
---------------------------------------
    Pg 94.  All forward slashes (/) in the examples should be backslashes (\).

    Pg 443. The example program for Fdatime() contains an incorrect
    version of the function fatal().  The code should read:

    fatal(args)
        char    *args;
    {
        _fprintf(stdout, args, &args+1);
        printf("\n");
        puts("Press RETURN to exit...");
        getchar();
        exit(1);
    }


10. GENERAL
-----------
    All programs will now print version information when given a -V
    option with no other options. e.g.

        ccom -v

    prints:

        Laser C: Compiler, version 1.01
