This disk contains the source code for libc.a in the following
directories:
	EXTRA, AES, UNIX, VDI, VDI2, ALINE
init.c is the source for the initialization code.

When compiling, pass the two flags:
	-DATARI -DNOVOID 
to the compiler.

Files under GEMDOS are limited to 8 characters.  Some files in libc.a
are longer.  To replace one of theses files you will have to remove
it then add it (rather than using the more direct replace ('r') meth-
od).  For instance:
	ar d initargcv.a libc.a
	ar r initargc.o libc.a
Also note that the original files in libc.a all end with '.a' rather
than '.o'.  These anomolies are a result of the method used to create
libc.a.
