
**** Information for converting between previous Megamax C versions and
****   the new Laser C


The C compiler used by Megamax C versions 1.0 and 1.1 (pre-Laser C) produced
code that used PC relative addressing. Globals, data and static variables were
referenced using the address register A4.  The Laser C compiler now produces
code using Absolute addressing for all function calls and global, data and
static references. 

The Object file formats used by Megamax C and Laser C are therefore not
compatible.  All code will have to be recompiled with the new compiler 
before being linked with code produced by the new compiler. Previous versions
of the compiler and linker should work under the new Laser Shell.

Because variables are accessed absolutely there is no need for register A4 and
A5. Thus Laser C allows two more registers for pointer register variables.

All "overlay" statements in the source code will have to be removed. This
is because overlays are not needed in Laser C.

The parameters to the function objc_edit() have changed.  See page 256 of the
Laser C manual for the correct usage.

Various routines in osbind.h have casts that return values of types
other than long. The cast can be removed from osbind.h if your code
depends on long's being returned.

abs() is no longer a macro.  Three new functions have been created:
abs(), labs() and dabs() (for int, long and double parameters respectively).

A change in a variable's storage class specifier is now considered to
be an error. e.g.:
	extern int i;   <-- error: Redeclaration of i
	static int i;
This means that implicit declarations won't work for functions later 
declared to be static.  Declare static functions before using them in
this case.
