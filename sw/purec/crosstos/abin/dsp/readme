
The following DSP tools should be found on this disk:

asm56000.ttp   assembler
          usage:    asm56000 -b ssilpbk.asm
             (Use asm56000 -b ssilpbk.asm > foo) to redirect output
               since scrolling text takes most of the assembly
               time.  Check foo for errors reported at end of file)
dsplnk.ttp     linker
          usage:    dsplnk -b ssilpbk.cln
cldlod.ttp     converts .cld files to .lod files
          usage:    cldlod ssilpbk.cld > ssilpbk.lod

Since .TTP programs won't support I/O redirection we included 
COMMAND.TOS which is a small shell with I/O redirection support. You 
could use commands like: cldlod.ttp ssilpbk.cld > ssilpbk.lod. It IS 
necesarry to type cldlod.ttp insteat of chllog since the shell needs 
that. If you rename cldlod.ttp to cldlod.prg than typing chllod is 
fine. This shell supports also batch files (.BAT) and even a file 
called AUTOEXEC.BAT.


Include in your 'C' files "dspbind.h" which is the DSP extension of
"osbind.h".
