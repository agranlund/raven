FPEmu v.241201
Software FPU emulator for 68000-68060
----------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations:

 - An emulated FPU is very slow.
   The purpose of the emulator is to be able to run programs that makes
   light use of floating point, nor not at all but still requires one.
   You need a real FPU to run FPU heavy applications.

 - Some programs look at the PCR register to detect 68060 LC/EC
   and there is nothing that can be done to trick these
   programs into using the emulated FPU.

   ! MiNT itself does this !

   You _can_ use this under MiNT but multitasking programs which use
   the virtual FPU can result in bad-things(tm) until MiNT has been taught
   to recognise the concept of emulated FPUs.
