
Uiptool

Uip-tools brings an easy way to upload or download files to your beloved
TOS machine without a need for MiNT or STING TCP/IP stacks.
It is a self contained binary, including a TCP/IP stack based on
uIP embedded stack with DHCP support included.


This build will only operate in FTP mode.
HTTP webserver is not included.

Main uip-tools repositry can be found here:
https://bitbucket.org/sqward/uip-tools/



## Security
Obviously, you should never expose your uiptool IP/port to the internet!
Absolutly no effort was expanded at hardening the uiptool.
It should *ONLY* be used in a trusted environment!


## FTP server
A simple FTP server on a default port is now available with a limited
command support. Although simple it is sufficient to allow most PC clients.
No login credentials are required. Anonumous login should work.
Also, any made up credentials will allow to login.

Make sure to use PASSIVE mode in your client!
Just use the IP address displayed by uiptool as your FTP server address.


## DHCP and STATIC IP Operating Mode
Uiptool can operate in two modes: DHCP or STATIC IP modes.

To toggle between DHCP and STATIC IP use F1 key.

When toggled for the first time a config fill will be saved
alongside uiptool executable. User is expected to edit that file with
a text editor to set IP address, netmask, and gateway which
corresponds with their configuration.
