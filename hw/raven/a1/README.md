## Errata / Notes for next revision:
- Silkscreen: J305 pinout mislabeled
- Silkscreen: U203 orientation is not obvious
- Silkscreen: J204-206,J305 orientation is not obvious
- Silkscreen: J301-304 orientation is not obvious
- Silkscreen: J103, J401 orientation is not obvious
- Footprints: D201-203 pads are small and hard to solder by hand
- Footprints: C601-603 hole spacing slightly too wide
- Footprints: C502-513 hole spacing slightly too wide
- Footprints: Y402 add a way to secure it (SMD pad at top to solder it in place)
- Components: C310 could probably be 0.1uF
- BOM: PLCC socket Preci-Dip 540-88-068-24-008 is brown, find black replacement
- BOM: PLCC socket Preci-Dip 540-88-084-24-008 is brown, find black replacement
- BOM: ATX connector TE 1-1775099-3 is white, find black replacement
- BOM: Buttons are red, find black replacement
- BOM: Jumpers TE 1-881545-4 are difficult to grab, pick a different variant
- PCB: Some kind of sign-of-life LEDs
- PCB: Combining excs/exbusen was a misstake. Separate signals could allow faster synchronous termination.
- PCB: A5 signal to CPLD is unused and the pin could potentially be freed up for something else
- PCB: SFP004 detection cannot neatly be prevented in software, route A6 to CPLD for hardware berr generation.
- PCB: Add hardware debounce the NMI switch
- PCB: Add header for one of MFP2 timer-outs (for pc-speaker type applications)
- PCB: Realtime clock should use +5VSB instead of +5V to reduce battery usage

## Future:
- PCB: Direct 060 bus expansion slot similar to Macintosh PDS
- PCB: Expose CPU internal temp pins, perhaps hook them to the Eiffel


## Untested:
- Midi In
