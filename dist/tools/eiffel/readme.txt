Notes on Raven:

- Raven does not support Eiffel LCD.

- Just like on CT60, Eiffel runtime is built into Ravens xbios.
  Do not use E_TEMP.PRG from the original Eiffel distribution.

- EiffelCF is unmodified from the original v1.10 version.
  Original binary+source packages can be found at Didiers website.
  In addition, the sourcecode for EiffelCF is included on Raven github:
  https://github.com/agranlund/raven
