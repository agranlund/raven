# Raven
### A homemade Atari clone computer based on Motorola 68060
This computer is primarily designed to be an Atari clone computer with
the goal of being able to natively run clean GEM/TOS applications, and backward compatibility with old ST games by help of software emulation.

## This is not a product.
It was designed as a one-off computer for myself for learning and as a platform for low-level programming. 
Thus, things like cost-reduction or other factors that might be important for a product was never high on the priority.

Hardware and software sources are provided as-is and for free but I cannot make any guarantees or promise of support, it's all very much work in progress.

The computer works and runs EmuTOS + FreeMiNT but if you decide to build or buy this board I very much recommend coming in with a DIY mindset.
It's early days still and waiting on drivers or fixes made by others could very well have you waiting indefinitely.
If you are into that sort of programming then this board could potentially provide a bunch of fun.
