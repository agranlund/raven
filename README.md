# Raven
### A homemade Atari clone computer based on Motorola 68060
This computer is primarily designed to be an Atari clone computer with
the goal of being able to natively run clean GEM/TOS applications, and backward compatibility with old ST games by help of software emulation.

## This is not a consumer product.
This computer was designed as a one-off creation for myself, for learning and as a platform for low-level tinkering. 
Things like cost-reduction or other factors that might be important for a product was never high on the priority.

Hardware and software sources are provided as-is and for free but comes with no guarantees or promise of support.


The computer works for me and runs EmuTOS + FreeMiNT but if you decide to build or buy this board I very much recommend coming in with a DIY mindset.
It's early days still and waiting on drivers or fixes made by others could very well have you waiting indefinitely.
If you are into hardware tinkering or low-level programming then this board could potentially provide a bunch of fun.

Knowledge and tools to perform hardware-level debugging and/or very low level software debugging is highly recommended.

It is easy to make misstakes during assembly and such skills can be vital for finding those. There is also always the risk that something out-of-the-box isn't quite right for your particular set of components - this board happening to working for me doesn't necessarily guarantee being production ready and working for all.
